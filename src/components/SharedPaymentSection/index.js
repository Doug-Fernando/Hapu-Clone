          Sometimes itâ€™s hard enough just sharing a restaurant bill.
          Try sharing that bill week in, week out and you might encounter
          more than a few snares. But not with Hapu. Simply set your rates
          and our automated payment system takes care of the rest.
          You need never talk money or who owes what
        </Text>
      </Container>
      <Divider />
    </>
