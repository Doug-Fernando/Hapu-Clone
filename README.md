# This project is a challenger of Jungle Devs
First of all, the way I did the application maybe it's not the best.

# How to run the application
Follow the steps below:
### Development mode
- `git clone git@github.com:Doug-Fernando/Hapu-Clone.git` - Clone the repository ( SSH ).
- `cd your-folder-name` - Enter the folder you cloned.
- `npm install` - Install the dependencies and dev-dependencies.
- `npm start` - Start the application.
After `npm start`, the application automatically should open in your browser using the URL `localhost:3000/`
### Build for production
- `git clone git@github.com:Doug-Fernando/Hapu-Clone.git` - Clone the repository ( SSH ).
- `cd your-folder-name` - Enter the folder you cloned.
- `npm install --production` - Install only the dependencies.
- `npm start` - Start the application.
After `npm start`, the application automatically should open in your browser using the URL `localhost:3000/`

#### PS: Maybe is missing something, it's my first time trying to compile for production. Your feedbacks are welcome.

It should show something like this for mobile version:

And for desktop:

## Please let your feedback
I'm working my English, so if I've written something wrong, please let me know. It'll help me so much.
The same for the application. Let your feedback and code review. 
Thank you
