# This project is a challenger of Jungle Devs
First of all, the way I did the application maybe it's not the best.

# How to run the application
Follow the steps below:
- `git clone *COMPLETE HERE*` - Clone the repository.
- `cd your-folder-name` - Enter the folder you cloned.
- `npm install` - Install the dependencies.
- `npm start` - Start the application.
After `npm start`, the application automatically should open in your browser using the URL `localhost:3000/`

It should show something like this:
