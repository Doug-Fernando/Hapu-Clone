# This project is a challenger of Jungle Devs
First of all, the way I did the application maybe it's not the best.
I used the inspect tool of `Microsoft Edge` and simulate the Iphone 6/7/8 Plus to construct all the application

## Changes I can do for make it better
- For refactor this project, I'd change all the CSS using `flexbox`. I tried to follow figma design as much I can and now I see the properties weren't the best for use in the construction.
- I've tested other mobile version and a few things are out of place, then I would fix for the other mobile versions.
- Create the desktop version

# How to run the application
First of all, you should clone the repository using the command `git clone *COMPLETE HERE*` in your CLI, then enter the folder you cloned the repository then run the commands below:
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
After `npm start`, the application automatically should open in your browser using the URL `localhost:3000/`

It should show something like this:

### Please let your feedback
I'm working my English, so if I've written something wrong, please let me know. I'll help me so much
The same thing for the application. Let your feedback and code review. 
Thank you
