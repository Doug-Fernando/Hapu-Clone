# This project is a challenger of Jungle Devs
First of all, the way I did the application maybe it's not the best.

The side image ( where show the pic of *Jane* and *Kate* in desktop version), I used the image given in figma because of the time. I've a idea how to do that, but i need to study about pseudo-elements: `.class::after` and `.class::before`.

# How to run the application
Follow the steps below:
### Development mode
- `git clone git@github.com:Doug-Fernando/Hapu-Clone.git` - Clone the repository ( SSH ).
- `cd your-folder-name` - Enter the folder you cloned.
- `npm install` - Install the dependencies and dev-dependencies.
- `npm start` - Start the application.
After `npm start`, the application automatically should open in your browser using the URL `localhost:3000/`
### Build for production
- `git clone git@github.com:Doug-Fernando/Hapu-Clone.git` - Clone the repository ( SSH ).
- `cd your-folder-name` - Enter the folder you cloned.
- `npm install --production` - Install only the dependencies.
- `npm start` - Start the application.
After `npm start`, the application automatically should open in your browser using the URL `localhost:3000/`

#### PS: Maybe is missing something, it's my first time trying to compile for production. Your feedbacks are welcome.

It should show something like this for mobile version:

And for desktop:

The same for the application. Let your feedback and code review.
